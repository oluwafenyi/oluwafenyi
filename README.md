### Hi there 👋

I'm Enyioma. I love automation (might be motivated by my laziness) and it is a big influence on what I learn and what I do. I write software mostly in Python, JavaScript and GoLang but I'm not really afraid to pick up any language that would get the job done. 

Here's a few things about me:
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- 🧑🏾‍🎓 I’m a Computer Science Undergrad
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (everything I can).
- 📫 How to reach me: [email](mailto:o.enyioma@gmail.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwafenyi)
- 🎮 When I'm not commiting code to GitHub I'm probably playing a video game.
